  <h1>Gamepad detection</h1>
  <p>
  Please connect a gamepad on one of the USB port (we have not tried any wireless gamepad yet). And press a button. <b>Then look at the console</b>.</p>
  <p>With Google Chrome the game pad is detected when you plug it and first interact with it.</p>
  <p>With FireFox it's detected as soon as you plug it.</p>
